When loading a synth for the first time, I would recommend using ""FLEX"" it is the best and most easy to use and was added after I made this video. 

Watch the FL Studio 20 Basics Playlist here : https://goo.gl/2Yxrf2

I try to simplify the DAW and it's signal flow for those who are not familiar with FL Studio's workflow.

This video shows how to navigate the Browser, Channel Rack, Playlist, Piano Roll and Mixer so that you can start making music :)
There are far too many features to cover in one video but luckily there are lots more (shorter) videos on each topic.

It can be used in any DAW if you have the vocodex plugin or any vocoder plugin. There are some great free vocoders out there including one from TAL.

You only need 3 things:
1) A vocal to be the Modulator
2) A synth or instrument to be the Carrier
3) The free vocoder plugin in FL Studio, Vocodex

It's also good to experiment with other modulators and carriers.
Maybe try a vocal and a piano?
Vocal and guitar? 
The possibilities are endless :)

ROLLING BASSLINE TUTORIAL | How to Make Rolling Bass FL Studio (Rolling Bass Trance, Techno, EDM)


if you’re an EDM producer, sooner or later you need to know how to make a strong rolling bassline. A rolling bassline, commonly found in trance, house or techno music, is a bass that follows an upbeat rhythm, or a sequence if you will.


But the problem starts if you don’t know how to make one or how to do it correctly. Else, you will end up with a lame bass or a pathetic mix, which is very frustrating and a waste of time.


That’s why I will give you all the essential steps to make an energetic rolling bassline AND keep an impressive mix. 

There are many people who can benefit from this video. Please share it with anyone you know.

FL STUDIO COMPRESSION TUTORIAL | How to Use Compressor FL Studio Tutorial | How to Compress FL Studio

In this video you will learn how to use the Fruity Compressor in FL Studio very easily. When you understand how this compressor works, you can use the same principles and apply it with any other compressor plugins. We will be using the Fruity Compressor because it's very basic and easy to understand.

People often make a big deal out of compression, but it's actually really simple. Especially when you understand what it comes down to.

So, what does a compressor do?

The only thing you need to remember is: a compressor controls the volume dynamics of your sound or mix. 

But what does that mean?

You can set a compressor to tell it WHEN and HOW it should change the volume of a signal. That's basically all it does. So, you determine when the compressor should be active and how the compressor should deal with the volume of a sound.

To do that there are a few buttons we can use. The Fruity Compressors has 6 knobs that we can control and set how we want it to act. Let’s take a look at all the knobs and then go to FL Studio for some live action.

THRESHOLD: determines the volume at which the compressor kicks in. If a certain amount of volume (dB) is reached, the compressor will start.
RATIO: determines the amount of compression. A low ratio results in ""weak"" compression and a high ratio results in ""aggressive"" compression.
GAIN: determines the volume of the compressed output signal. You can normalize or limit the output sound by changing the Gain.
ATTACK: determines the time (in milliseconds) it takes to reach full compression. It basically sets the moment the compressor should start working.
RELEASE: determines the time (in milliseconds) it takes for the compressor to stop acting. It basically sets the moment the compressor should stop working.
TYPE: determines the ""type"" of compression. It controls the rate at which compression is applied. SOFT means gradual increase of compression. HARD means immediate increase of compression. VINTAGE and MEDIUM are in between those 2 extremes.

To simplify:

TRESHOLD: the volume at which the compressor starts.
RATIO: the amount of compression.
GAIN: the volume after the compression is applied.
ATTACK: How long it takes for the compressor to start.
RELEASE: How long it takes for the compressor to stop.
TYPE: the rate of compression.

Common practices for using compression is to create snappy attacks in certain sounds or to make a sound pump more. Let's explore both of these by compressing a snare sample. The sample is from my free sample pack. You can download it via the link above.

Think of the FL Studio Mobile project as the core of the track. SHARE the .flm project between your desktop computer and your mobile device, adding and developing the project. When working inside the desktop version you can take advantage of the greater CPU to enhance it with the highest quality instrument and effect plugins in use by professionals. Alternatively you can make far more complex projects than your mobile device can handle. When transferring the project back, you can mute tracks to keep the CPU use under control.

FL STUDIO ARP TUTORIAL | How to Make an Arpeggiator in FL Studio Arpeggio Trance Arp EDM Arps

Hey, here's Cep again. Do you want to find out how to make an arpeggio in FL Studio very quickly and easily? You do? Great! I'll show you how.

To make an arp (which stands for arpeggio or arpeggiator), you first need to have a sound. A lead type of sound would be good, like the 3x Osc sound in the video. With that sound, it's a good idea to draw long notes on the Piano Roll. These notes will be chopped up later by the arpeggiator. You can even make chords like I did.

To access the arpeggiator in FL Studio, click the ""Miscellaneous functions"" tab of your sound. In this tab you can find a section called ""Arpeggiator"". An arpeggiator can give fast (or slow) rhythms to your sound, using different patterns and notes.

In the video I will play with all of its settings, so you can take a listen to how it changes the sound.

For the full transcript and article visit:

So, there it is: a quick and easy way to make arps. Make sure to visit the links in the description above to get access to extra resources that will help you make awesome music.

Do you want to find out how to make an arpeggio in FL Studio very quickly and easily? You do? Great! I\'ll show you how.\n\nTo make an arp (which stands for arpeggio or arpeggiator), you first need to have a sound. A lead type of sound would be good, like the 3x Osc sound in the video. With that sound, it\'s a good idea to draw long notes on the Piano Roll. These notes will be chopped up later by the arpeggiator. You can even make chords like I did.\n\nTo access the arpeggiator in FL Studio, click the ""Miscellaneous functions"" tab of your sound. In this tab you can find a section called ""Arpeggiator"". An arpeggiator can give fast (or slow) rhythms to your sound, using different patterns and notes.\n\nIn the video I will play with all of its settings, so you can take a listen to how it changes the sound.\n\nFor the full transcript and article visit:\nhttps://screechhouse.com/fl-studio-arp-tutorial-how-to-make-an-arpeggiator-in-fl-studio-arpeggio-trance-arp-edm-arps\n\nSo, there it is: a quick and easy way to make arps. Make sure to visit the links in the description above to get access to extra resources that will help you make awesome music.\n\nIf you found this video to be helpful, I\'d really appreciate it if you could hit that LIKE button.\n\nIf you have any questions you would like me to answer, just leave a COMMENT down below.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nWANT TO HELP THE CHANNEL GROW?\nTo reach more people, simply share a link or video with one of your friends to introduce them to my work.

Think of the FL Studio Mobile project as the core of the track. SHARE the .flm project between your desktop computer and your mobile device, adding and developing the project. When working inside the desktop version you can take advantage of the greater CPU to enhance it with the highest quality instrument and effect plugins in use by professionals. Alternatively you can make far more complex projects than your mobile device can handle. When transferring the project back, you can mute tracks to keep the CPU use under control.

RAWSTYLE SCREECH TUTORIAL | How to Make a Rawstyle Screech (Rawstyle FL Studio Hardstyle Screech Tutorial)

In this video you'll learn how to make a rawstyle screech in FL Studio. I will be using the 3xOsc to create the sound.

The pitch settings are often very important and can really help to make your screech scream. For these types of screeches, a good amount of detune is also desired. This helps to give it that ""ripping/tearing"" sound.

A delay and reverb are always nice. They're basically a ""must"" for your sounds. The settings are personal taste though.

Hopefully this gave you some valuable insights.

228,yi0J9JsRdI4,2019-10-19T17:30:19Z,UCIcCXe3iWo6lq-iWKV40Oug,How To Use Compression - Detailed Tutorial,"Hi I'm Michael Wynne. I'm a Scottish audio engineer and founder of In The Mix.

Understanding compression and how to hear it is an essential mixing skill.
In this video, I am going into a huge amount of detail to explain how to deeply hear and understand vocal compression so that you are no longer confused. I will show you all the important settings while compressing vocals and guitar.

Video Notes:
1) Listen to compression when all your tracks are playing, if you can't hear the other instruments and vocals it is usually a waste of time (unless you are highly experienced...in which case...why do you watch my videos!)

2) Often you need compression to make a vocal sound natural in a mix, surprisingly - This is due to how the microphone picks up some peoples voice

3) Have an Aim! If you don't know what you are aiming for, how will you be able to guarantee a good result? When you listen to the uncompressed audio, ask yourself:
""What do I want to change?"" 
""Do I need more sustain on this vocal?"" 
""Are my vocals too punchy or transient?"" 

4) Compression Settings

▶Threshold 
The point or level in dB where the compression will start being applied.

▶Ratio 
How much compression should be applied?
2:1 = Gentle Compression
10:1 = Aggressive Compression

A ratio of 4:1 means that the signal has to go 4dB above the threshold to get 1dB out (3db of compression)
8dB over = 2dB out etc ( 6db of compression!)
This 4:1 ratio means only 25% of the signal above the threshold will pass through, so this is very noticeable.

A ratio of 2:1 means that for every 2 dB the signal goes over the threshold, the compressor will only allow 1 dB through, so this only allows 50% of the signal above the threshold to pass through, this is considered gentle.

The higher the number, the more gain reduction will be experienced when the signal passes the threshold. 20:1 and higher is usually getting into the range of limiting, where you have a virtually infinite ratio to prevent any peaks.

▶Attack 
How fast should the compression start after the threshold is passed?
Fast attack time = Heavy, soft vocals
Slower attack = Punchy, transient vocals

▶Release 
How fast does the compressor recover after the signal falls below the threshold?
Slow release = Mushy vocals 
Fast release = Choppy vocals

▶Makeup Gain
Compression turns your audio signal down, so we apply a boost at the end to bring it back up to the original level. With this boost applied and the peaks brought down, the overall signal is louder and more full!

▶Knee 
The knee of a compressor makes the threshold act more smoothly, so that compression is triggered in a smoother or more gradual manner. Experiment to see if it gives you a more natural tone.

I\'m a Scottish audio engineer and founder of In The Mix.\n\nUnderstanding compression and how to hear it is an essential mixing skill.\nIn this video, I am going into a huge amount of detail to explain how to deeply hear and understand vocal compression so that you are no longer confused. I will show you all the important settings while compressing vocals and guitar.\n\nVideo Notes:\n1) Listen to compression when all your tracks are playing, if you can\'t hear the other instruments and vocals it is usually a waste of time (unless you are highly experienced...in which case...why do you watch my videos!)\n\n2) Often you need compression to make a vocal sound natural in a mix, surprisingly - This is due to how the microphone picks up some peoples voice\n\n3) Have an Aim! If you don\'t know what you are aiming for, how will you be able to guarantee a good result? When you listen to the uncompressed audio, ask yourself:\n""What do I want to change?"" \n""Do I need more sustain on this vocal?"" \n""Are my vocals too punchy or transient?"" \n\n4) Compression Settings\n\n▶Threshold \nThe point or level in dB where the compression will start being applied.\n\n▶Ratio \nHow much compression should be applied?\n2:1 = Gentle Compression\n10:1 = Aggressive Compression\n\nA ratio of 4:1 means that the signal has to go 4dB above the threshold to get 1dB out (3db of compression)\n8dB over = 2dB out etc ( 6db of compression!)\nThis 4:1 ratio means only 25% of the signal above the threshold will pass through, so this is very noticeable.\n\nA ratio of 2:1 means that for every 2 dB the signal goes over the threshold, the compressor will only allow 1 dB through, so this only allows 50% of the signal above the threshold to pass through, this is considered gentle.\n\nThe higher the number, the more gain reduction will be experienced when the signal passes the threshold. 20:1 and higher is usually getting into the range of limiting, where you have a virtually infinite ratio to prevent any peaks.\n\n▶Attack \nHow fast should the compression start after the threshold is passed?\nFast attack time = Heavy, soft vocals\nSlower attack = Punchy, transient vocals\n\n▶Release \nHow fast does the compressor recover after the signal falls below the threshold?\nSlow release = Mushy vocals \nFast release = Choppy vocals\n\n▶Makeup Gain\nCompression turns your audio signal down, so we apply a boost at the end to bring it back up to the original level.

It is used to simulate, with high precision, natural acoustic spaces and Hardware reverb units.

It does this using convolution mathematics and an impulse response of the room/hardware. Luckily for us, we don't need to know anything complicated to get fantastic results that are not possibly with an algorithmic reverb like Fruity Reverb 2.

RAWSTYLE MELODY TUTORIAL | Making a Rawstyle Melody & Lead in FL Studio: LIVE SESSION

In this video you'll learn how to make a rawstyle melody & lead in FL Studio 12. Note that this is a LIVE session. You can see me tweaking, arranging and making some mistakes in the process. Hopefully this way you might learn even more.

For the rawstyle synth I use Sylenth1. For the reverb I use Valhalla. The other effects I use just come with FL Studio (stock plugins).

The final result is some kind of emotional rawstyle, but it can also grow in an dark euphoric rawstyle song.

For the reverb I use Valhalla. The other effects I use just come with FL Studio (stock plugins).\n\nThe final result is some kind of emotional rawstyle, but it can also grow in an dark euphoric rawstyle song.\n\nIf you found this video to be helpful, I'd really appreciate it if you could hit that LIKE button.\n\nIf you have any questions you would like me to answer, just leave a COMMENT down below.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nWANT TO HELP THE CHANNEL GROW?\nTo reach more people, simply share a link or video with one of your friends to introduce them to my work.

HARDSTYLE TOK TUTORIAL | How to Make Hardstyle Punch Kick | Hardstyle Kick FL Studio Kick Tutorial

Hey guys, it's Cep here. In this video I will show you how to build the TOK or PUNCH part of a hardstyle kick in FL Studio. 

First you need to have a hardstyle kick TAIL, like this one here. Watch my other hardstyle kick videos to learn how to make these. Now you can sample this tail part and cut out elements to use for your tok. I always cut out the tok part, the ""tick"" part and the clean 909 kick part (from the undistorted signal). Just like I show you here.

- The tok is about 100 ms long.
- The tick is about 10-20 ms long.
- The 909 kick is about 200 ms long.

So, everything is cut from the original kick tail. We're going to use this now to build a tok.

Everything I do is FL Studio ONLY. This way you can always use my video as a guide. It saves you a lot of money as well (for buying ""special"" plugins).

The samples we just cut are now added to the playlist in a new FL project. It's good to arrange them in the order I have here: tick, tok, 909. There is an automation clip underneath each sample. This controls the volume. It allows for full control over the ""length"" of each sample.

The TICK is there for the snappy attack. It's short, snappy and has extra high frequencies. The TOK is there for the body and mid frequencies. I found that separating the TOK from the TICK a bit, helps to get more punch. It sounds better. The 909 is there to give the punch more ""oompff"", more bass and more power. Again, separating it from the TOK a bit helps to make it sound right.

If you haven't yet, you can download a free hardstyle sample pack via the link above. It also contains all these hardstyle kick elements.

Hopefully this video helps your hardstyle kicks. Feel free to check out my EDM Mixing Guide in the description and don't forget to click SUBSCRIBE. :-)

FL STUDIO CHOIR TUTORIAL | How to Make Choir in FL Studio | Choir Hardstyle Choir Effect Choir Sound

In this video you'll learn how to make a choir sound in FL Studio, with Sytrus. This basically works for any type of EDM genre. I will simply be showing you all the settings. I started with the Choir 2 preset in Sytrus and changed some parameters to get this sound.

Oscillator 1 actually isn't active. You can as well ignore these settings. In this moment of ""ignorance"", make sure you don't forget to grab my free sample pack. Download it via the link above.

Oscillator 2 is the only active oscillator. Just look at the settings, especially the type of waveform on the top left. 

Only filter 1 is enabled and it's set to a LP3 type of filter (Low Pass 3). The DRIVE knob works well to boost the signal, so I turned it open.

In the FX section, only the chorus is enabled. It's set to 4 voices with quite some depth and speed. This helps to add some fullness and movement to the sound.

The Sytrus is routed to a mixer track. Here we can give it some extra effects. The first effect in the chain is an EQ. With the EQ the sound is shaped to remove some mid frequencies and add some high frequencies. The waveshaper doesn't do much. It boosts the volume slightly. Of course, the choir synth needs some reverb. This gives it a sense of space. I used the Valhalla reverb here and shaped it with some effects.

This is all as far as the sound goes. Keep in mind that you can tweak it however you want. It's a matter of taste and what sounds good in your mix.

Now let's play some chords with it! If you don't know chords, please watch my ""How to Make Chords in FL Studio"" video. Drawing longer notes like I do, makes it sound more string-like or pad-like.

To put this choir sound into perspective, I used this hardstyle / rawstyle melody. Just try to pay attention to the choirs in this little snippet. Listen how it adds something to the melody and atmosphere. It fills up the sound and it plays well with the melody. Pretty string-like.

How do you get it to play well with the melody? That's actually really easy! The notes of the choir sound follow the exact same chords as the melody. You can clearly see this when I place the choir sound on top of the melody. The grey notes represent the melody. Again, please take a look at my how to chords video. There you'll learn more about this. Each first note of a chord change is always your starting point. Just draw longer notes from there and they automatically fit.

Before we go, let me quickly show you the Sytrus Choir presets. You can start there and tweak the sound to your liking. There are many plugins with great choir sounds, but I simply wanted to show you a good FL Studio ONLY option. There's really plenty to choose from.

272,2mqibVWgKsw,2015-10-12T03:46:43Z,UC313K63WEDXCZE3-9lzXosQ,FL Studio 12 Tutorial - 11 - Steps per beat in FL Studio,"Now let us take a look into this ‘Steps per beat’.

From the previous video, remember our settings. It is still in these. Beat per bar is 4 and Steps per beat is 1.

Now let me play the metronome and record a melody.

I know that each rhythm note is a beat and I have 4 beats per bar.

Let me record the melody. And paste it in the playlist. Then let me make a rhythm for it.

Here, I can play only one rhythm note in beat. This single note fills the entire gap between two beats.

What is I wanted to play more rhythm notes those gaps?

FL Studio allows us to do that by splitting the beat into two or more steps. If I split a beat into 4 steps, then the first step falls on the beat. The next three steps fills in the gap between that beat and the next beat. And it goes like that.

Why do we need that? To make the rhythm interesting. Otherwise the rhythm could get boring.

So, this option ‘Steps per beat’ specifies the number of steps in beat.

What is FL Studio?

FL Studio is a leading Music Production System which can be used to compose and create songs. 

If you are into song composition, FL Studio might help you.

Also, I hope this tutorial series is helpful.","{'default': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2mqibVWgKsw/default.jpg', 'width': 120, 'height': 90}, 'medium': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2mqibVWgKsw/mqdefault.jpg', 'width': 320, 'height': 180}, 'high': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2mqibVWgKsw/hqdefault.jpg', 'width': 480, 'height': 360}, 'standard': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2mqibVWgKsw/sddefault.jpg', 'width': 640, 'height': 480}, 'maxres': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2mqibVWgKsw/maxresdefault.jpg', 'width': 1280, 'height': 720}}",Sam D,"['FL Studio (Software)', 'FL Studio 12', 'FL Studio 12 Tutorial', 'FL Studio free', 'FL Studio Tutorial', 'ITShorts.com', 'Sampath.com', 'Sam Dhanasekaran', 'Dhanasekaran', 'Music Production', 'Songwriting', 'Songwriter', 'Music Theory', 'MIDI', 'Musical Instrument Digital Interface', 'FLStudio', 'FLStudio 12', 'bar', 'beats per minute', 'tempo', 'music meter', 'steps per beat']",27,none,"{'title': 'FL Studio 12 Tutorial - 11 - Steps per beat in FL Studio', 'description': 'Now let us take a look into this ‘Steps per beat’.\n\nFrom the previous video, remember our settings.

Link to the .flp file: http://www.speedyshare.com/files/19497402/kick_tut.zip
Its a FL zipped loop file so just drag&drop ;) in this file i also cloned the tok sampler and pitched it down a bit ;)

Here is a sample of another kick i created using this technique:
http://www.speedyshare.com/366568910.html

And here is the link to download this tutorial in higher quality:
http://rapidshare.com/files/183520294/kick_tutorial_compiled_-_02_.wmv

When i started making hardstyle i had most trouble creating good kicks, and i searched youtube for tutorials but couldnt find any good one(taking a fruity kick and adding fast dist isnt going to make you a hs kick:P)

The kick in HS is very important, and it is very hard to get it to sound right, with special characteristics. But it is so much better to be able to make your own ones instead of just taking a blutonium boy hardkick sample ;P its the way to go if you want to make your music original!

Now that im starting to get the hang of it i thought i could make a tutorial for all of you who are new to hardstyle producing ;)

This kick maby didnt get specially good, but thats not the point, i just make a quick kick here to show you my technique, so you have an idea on how it can be done. And remember that i just make and export one kick, normally i make up to 3-4 kick samples and layer toghether (but i didnt have time for that now) You can also layer in a equalized snare sample or clap sample or other instruments ;) Its just important to quicly chop off everything after the ""tok"" of the kick with a cutoff filter -a hs kick is supposed to have a short punch(but a long released bass)

I use a vst called ""CamelPhat"" it makes creating hs kicks easy, but its basically a filter with bandpass and a built in distortion\overdrive generator. Hs kicks normally have a resonance at about 500-800hz (the frequency where the kick is distorted or equalized prominently\eminent)

Camelchrusher is the distortion part of camelphat, and u can download it for free from their website: http://www.camelaudio.com/camelcrusher.php
But it soesnt have the ""fat bandpass filter"" so youll have to improvise here and add a fruity filter INFRONT of camelchrusher and set it to bandpass at about 700hz..

And i use KarmaFX`s reverb on the tok, you can download karmafx plugin pack for free on their website ;)

Mijn naam is Jacob Kroodsma. Ik hou van muziek maken in mijn vrije tijd en raak erg geïnspireerd door het luisteren van Hardstyle en Hardcore. Mijn droom is ook om ooit op het festival DEFQON.1 te draaien als artiest. Ik blijf veel oefenen en leer elke dag weer nieuwe dingen met produceren.

Think of the FL Studio Mobile project as the core of the track. SHARE the .flm project between your desktop computer and your mobile device, adding and developing the project. When working inside the desktop version you can take advantage of the greater CPU to enhance it with the highest quality instrument and effect plugins in use by professionals. Alternatively you can make far more complex projects than your mobile device can handle. When transferring the project back, you can mute tracks to keep the CPU use under control.

RAWSTYLE KICK TUTORIAL | How to Make a Rawstyle Kick | FL Studio Rawstyle Kick FL Studio (Tail Only)

In this video you will discover how to make a rawstyle kick in FL Studio. I will be using FL Studio plugins ONLY.

Be aware that this video is solely for the TAIL part of the kick. The tail is often the hardest part for most people and requires the most tweaking.

Let's start with disabling all the mixer effects and look at the 3x Osc settings that creates the 909-ish kick signal. Starting out with 1 oscillator and a triangle waveform. You can make kicks with any of these waveforms, but typically set it to triangle or sine.

I always set a volume envelope for the signal to fade out naturally. Also a pitch envelope to create a punch/oompff. The way you set this, isn't really that important. Just go by taste.

The kick signal is routed to mixer track 1 where all the effects are applied. Let's enable them 1 by 1 and discover what I did. 

As always: using EQ's & distortions to create the raw kick. Rawstyle kicks need that big boost in the area around 400-500 Hz in my experience. You could use some reverb to give the kick some sense of space. It can make your kick sound a bit bigger. 

For some reason this happened to sound this way. It's a pretty quick band pass sweep to create a little bit more ""growl"" and movement. 

Some more EQing... it makes the kick sound shorter and “bouncier”. Again, some reverb for a little bit more space. And last but not least, another distortion unit to finish it off.

Easy! :-) All right. Let's start tweaking some of all the settings here. This gives you an impression of how they shape and change the signal. Simply watch me play and listen to the kick sound...

Bear in mind that building a kick is always a creative process. Just play with all the settings until it starts to sound good. 

You can play with this kick tail yourself, when you download the FLP file via the link above. If you decide to purchase this project, don't worry if there's a problem. We will find a solution or you will get your money back. If you're happy, I'm happy, else you don't have to contribute anything.

As you can hear, many settings have a big impact on the sound of the kick. They can either improve the sound or mess it up.

Just start somewhere and simply keep tweaking UNTIL it sounds better or closer to a rawstyle/hardstyle kick. Then move on to the next effect and make it better again.

To help you build your hardstyle songs, I also made a free hardstyle sample pack. Download via the link above if you haven't yet. It can save you a lot of time by simply using some of my pre-made samples. That's where it's for.

Anyways, if you ask me, this rawstyle kick tail sounds freaking brutal. And as you can see, totally NO NEED for expensive third-party plugins or special equipment. FL Studio is all you need.

Just click the download links at the top of the description to get the FLP file or to get the free sample pack. 

Enjoy! - Cep

In diesem Produzenten Tutorial gehe ich aber dabei nur auf die FL Studio 12 Grundlagen ein. Es ist sehr einsteigerfreundlich und dieses Mal gebe ich euch eine erste Übersicht zum Browser.

Das ist mein zweites Tutorial meiner ""FL Studio 12 Tutorial Auf Deutsch"" Playlist/Serie. In weiteren Videos dieser Playlist, geht es dann um die erste Übersicht und den ersten Grundeinstellungen, zum Channel Rack oder Step Sequenzer, zur Playlist und zum Mixer! Tutorials für fortgeschrittene Musikproduzenten zu Themen wie Mixing, Mastering, Type Beats machen/bauen, Mixing Analysen, Song/Beat Reaktionen, Beatmaking Tutorials uvm., werden sehr bald da sein. 

Dieses Video ist sehr gut geeignet für Einsteiger in der Musikproduktion, für alle die DAWs wechseln und davor z.B. Cubase, Logic, Ableton, Studio One etc. verwendet haben oder für Wiedereinsteiger, die wieder Lust auf Beats bauen, Abmischen usw. haben! 😀 Es wird hier erstmal nur auf die Basics eingegangen!

Nicht vergessen zu abonnieren, um keine weiteren Videos rund um die Musikproduktion zu verpassen! 👇

In this tutorial you will learn how to use compression to make sounds have more punch, make sounds louder, and also glue sounds together.

Using compression on synthesizer sounds has very little effect other than glueing together different instruments in terms of volume. Using compression on real life recorded instruments and vocals is very useful to tame the dynamic range of the recording. They are also useful in live show situations for live bands.

You can use compression on single instruments, a bus of instruments together, and even the master bus!

Compressors are very popular and powerful tools that many producers use in genres like EDM, Trap, House, Pop, Rock or any other genre!

There are many types of compressors but all of them do pretty much the same thing. In this video I will be using the stock FL Studio one for this tutorial.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the comments and I will answer them!

365,GZtgKJgZOLU,2020-12-12T17:00:07Z,UCIcCXe3iWo6lq-iWKV40Oug,FL Studio Frequency Splitter Tutorial (20.8),"In this video I show you some ways to use the new Frequency Splitter Stock Plugin in FL Studio 20.8.
It's excellent for parallel processing, vocal mixing, splitting stems and advanced filtering. I especially like it for parallel bass processing and vocal mixing. 

Frequency Splitter separates the incoming audio into 2 or 3 bands using low latency or Linear Phase filters. You can select send destinations for each band and solo or mute any band. This is an immensly useful and practical plugin and I hope it can speed up and streamline your workflow. The vocals and piano are performed by my friend David for his project, The Workday Release.

2:45 - Vocal Processing/mixing
4:50 - Linear Phase Modes 
6:10 - Linear Phase warning! 
9:50 - Livestreams coming soon 

FL Studio 20.8 will be released on Monday and I wanted to make sure you were up to speed and could make the most of this plugin. If you want to try it out right now, you can find the 20.8 RC in the looptalk forum.

Think of the FL Studio Mobile project as the core of the track. SHARE the .flm project between your desktop computer and your mobile device, adding and developing the project. When working inside the desktop version you can take advantage of the greater CPU to enhance it with the highest quality instrument and effect plugins in use by professionals. Alternatively you can make far more complex projects than your mobile device can handle. When transferring the project back, you can mute tracks to keep the CPU use under control.

MELODY TUTORIAL | How to Make a Melody in FL Studio (EDM) | Tips for Beginners

In this video you'll learn an easy method how to make melodies. This method is especially useful when you don't have a lot of musical talent. 

To create good melodies, we simply use some rules that help as guidance. The rules are simple:

1. Make sure you've enabled the ""Scale highlighting"" helper on the piano roll (set it on ""Automatic""). When it's enabled, FL Studio will tell you which scale it thinks you are using. In this example, I'm using the F minor scale. A scale basically tells you which notes you CAN use and which notes you CANNOT use.

2. Simply pick a musical scale and stick to it. You can ONLY use the notes on this scale. I've chosen the F minor scale.

3. Make a musical loop with the lower layer of the melody (the carriers). This has to be an F minor loop. So, it's easiest just to start with an F note. Always check on the piano roll helper if your lower notes play an F minor loop. If it doesn't say ""F minor"", change it until it does.

4. Make a musical loop with the upper layer (top layer) that creates the real melody.
 - Make sure your first note is a chord of the lower note. In this example, G# is a chord of F in the minor scale. 
 - The total upper melody needs to be an F minor loop as well. Only select the upper layer to see if FL says it's played as  F minor.

TIP: The lower notes we created before, can play the same rhythm as the upper melody. This makes it sound as a unity. It generally should say ""F minor"" as well.

5. Optionally, copy the lower layer, paste it and move it down 1 octave. This makes the melody sound heavier.

NOTE: For a beginner this is more than enough to get you started!

6. For the more advanced, make a musical loop with the middle layer. These are also always part of the chords the scale (F minor) dictates. See which notes within the chords are still ""free"" to use and build from there. In this example, the very first notes now are F (lower) and G# (upper). The note C is still available within that chord. Use that and build from there.

Always try to use your ears and make sure it sounds good to you. This takes some practice. That's why I tried to create these rules to help you guide. But these are NOT hard rules. These are strategies.

Hopefully this helps your melodies!

In this video I have shown you how to Master a song in Fl Studio. It covers all the steps to master any track. I have shown all the procedures and rules to follow before starting the main master process. From this video you will be able to judge a song and be able to fix it. 

Mastering is a very creative process. There are no golden numbers for mastering. I have tried my best to explain you what to do in each case. Mastering can also be said as to increase the volume of a track commercially. It is a very important and the final step in music production before you release your track for the whole world to listen. Always use a very good headphone or studio monitors to master a song. 

I am not professional Mastering Engineer, but for the context of this video I have shared with you what I generally do to Master a Song.

You might notice that there was no headroom when I imported the mix. Generally before exporting the mix the volume of the Master Fader is lowered to upto -4 to -5 dB to create headroom. But it can also be done afterwards with Fruity Balance.

Plugins I used in the video:
1. iZotope Ozone 5 Advance
2. Fabfilter Pro Q2
3. FabFilter Pro L
4. PSP Vintage warmer 2

You can also use OTT if you want

Also Mastering ain't going to change the song completely. It does not do any magic. Your mix should sound perfect before you Master because then only you will be happy with your finished product.

Think of the FL Studio Mobile project as the core of the track. SHARE the .flm project between your desktop computer and your mobile device, adding and developing the project. When working inside the desktop version you can take advantage of the greater CPU to enhance it with the highest quality instrument and effect plugins in use by professionals. Alternatively you can make far more complex projects than your mobile device can handle. When transferring the project back, you can mute tracks to keep the CPU use under control.

No se considera como un tutorial para masterizar profesionalmente. Aquí  muestro varias formas y procedimientos que se llevan acabo hoy en día, más no son los únicos ni más avanzados procedimientos ya que se pueden hacer de diferentes formas con diferentes herramientas.

Al terminar la masterización se recomienda exportar en wav 16 bits con la opción de dithering activada (ya sea de FL Studio o de Ozone 5) y 320 kbps en mp3 :) .

Vooraan in de film zie je de afbeelding die ik heb gebruikt om dit te maken.
Voor de muziek heb ik een willekeurig nummer gebruikt.

Voor je begint zet je je eigen gemaakte track op loop, 
en speel je die tijdens het maken van de clip af.. 
Zo kun je namelijk zien wat het logo voor bewegingen 
maakt bij het afspelen van de track. 
En vanuit daar kun je dan makkelijk de verhoudingen 
van de visualisaties aanpassen.

Think of the FL Studio Mobile project as the core of the track. SHARE the .flm project between your desktop computer and your mobile device, adding and developing the project. When working inside the desktop version you can take advantage of the greater CPU to enhance it with the highest quality instrument and effect plugins in use by professionals. Alternatively you can make far more complex projects than your mobile device can handle. When transferring the project back, you can mute tracks to keep the CPU use under control.

See you guys soon🖐️

SAMPLE PACK TUTORIAL | How to Install Sample Packs in FL Studio | How to Use Samples in FL Studio Sound Packs

In this video I will show you how to install sample packs or how to use samples in FL Studio. When you download a sample pack, it's typically ""packed"" as a .ZIP file and stored somewhere on your hard drive. To use a .ZIP file, you first need to extract its content. To extract its content, you need to have an app that can do this. I use WinRAR for this.

Simply click the right mouse button and press ""Extract Here"". The content of the .ZIP file will now get unpacked, ready to use. You can now delete the .ZIP file if you want. The folder and files that came out of the .ZIP file are now ready to use.

So, go to the folder of your downloaded sample pack and extract its content. Now let's see how to use the samples in FL Studio.

I'll show you 2 very simple ways how to ""install"" a sample pack in FL Studio.

For the first method, find the sample pack on your hard drive. We're going to use this location on the hard drive to tell FL Studio where the samples are located.

In FL Studio go to ""Options"" and then ""File settings"". A window will appear where we need to look at the ""Browser extra search folder"" section. Now find the location of your sample pack or music library. Select the folder and click ""OK"". After you've clicked ""OK"", the full location path will be displayed. This is good. FL Studio now recognizes this folder. 

To access your samples go to ""View"" and then ""Browser"". The browser will appear. And when you look closely, you'll see the new samples folder. You can now browse your sample pack, find the samples you want to use and of course, add them to your song. Either drag and drop a sample in your channel rack 
(or playlist) or click the right mouse button and select ""Open in new channel"".

Piece of cake! 

Let's go to the second method. The second method is very similar.

Also here: find the location of your sample pack on your hard drive in Windows. Leave the folder open and go to FL Studio. Go to ""View"" and then ""Browser"". The browser already has a folder called ""User"".

So, you can simply use this folder as your music library. Click right on this ""User"" folder and select ""Open"". A Windows window will appear. Mine is already full, but that doesn't matter. Now simply copy the original sample pack folder and paste it in the new opened ""User"" folder. You could also just drag and drop the folder from 1 location to the other.

When we go back to FL Studio, look in the browser and select the ""User"" folder. We can see our just copied sample pack, ready to use. Now it's just a matter of browsing through the samples, finding the ones we like and adding them to the channel rack or playlist.

For this video I used my own sample pack as an example. You can download it for free via the link above.

The browser will appear. And when you look closely, you\'ll see the new samples folder. You can now browse your sample pack, find the samples you want to use and of course, add them to your song. Either drag and drop a sample in your channel rack \n(or playlist) or click the right mouse button and select ""Open in new channel"".\n\nPiece of cake! \n\nLet\'s go to the second method. The second method is very similar.\n\nAlso here: find the location of your sample pack on your hard drive in Windows. Leave the folder open and go to FL Studio. Go to ""View"" and then ""Browser"". The browser already has a folder called ""User"".\n\nSo, you can simply use this folder as your music library. Click right on this ""User"" folder and select ""Open"". A Windows window will appear. Mine is already full, but that doesn\'t matter. Now simply copy the original sample pack folder and paste it in the new opened ""User"" folder. You could also just drag and drop the folder from 1 location to the other.\n\nWhen we go back to FL Studio, look in the browser and select the ""User"" folder. We can see our just copied sample pack, ready to use. Now it\'s just a matter of browsing through the samples, finding the ones we like and adding them to the channel rack or playlist.\n\nFor this video I used my own sample pack as an example. You can download it for free via the link above. \n\nIf you found this video to be helpful, I\'d really appreciate it if you could hit that LIKE button.\n\nIf you have any questions you would like me to answer, just leave a COMMENT down below.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nWANT TO HELP THE CHANNEL GROW?\nTo reach more people, simply share a link or video with one of your friends to introduce them to my work.

Trabajo así en el Piano Roll porque no cuento con un Teclado de Música...

Hola, aqui les traigo un nuevo tutorial y es sobre como hacer una pista de Rap Romantico en Fl Studio 12...

Espero ayudarles un poco con lo que se. Así es como yo hago una pista de Rap. No soy profesional ni pretendo serlo solo subo lo que me gusta hacer con la intención de ayudar a aquellas personas que buscan aprender lo básico.. :)

GRACIAS por ver el video y GRACIAS  si viste mi anterior video.. me alegra mucho que sin ser profesional en esto, recibí mucho apoyo en mi primer tutorial, en 3 meses alcancé las 9.000 visitas y eso para mi es Gratificante y Emocionante.. 
Que Dios te bendiga siempre.. :)
