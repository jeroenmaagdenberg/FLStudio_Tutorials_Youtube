pDIsEZsalAo,2018-05-23T15:33:40Z,UCIcCXe3iWo6lq-iWKV40Oug,FL Studio 20  -  Complete Beginner Basics Tutorial,"This video is the first in the FL Studio 20 Basics Playlist and is to help those who are completely new to FL Studio and are looking for a place to start. When loading a synth for the first time, I would recommend using ""FLEX"" it is the best and most easy to use and was added after I made this video. 

Watch the FL Studio 20 Basics Playlist here : https://goo.gl/2Yxrf2

I try to simplify the DAW and it's signal flow for those who are not familiar with FL Studio's workflow.

This video shows how to navigate the Browser, Channel Rack, Playlist, Piano Roll and Mixer so that you can start making music :)
There are far too many features to cover in one video but luckily there are lots more (shorter) videos on each topic.

Video 2 👉 https://youtu.be/I38Fnaah8Qw
All the free videos are watchable from the above link.

About the course:

By taking this course you’re going to learn to make music in FL Studio by actually creating a track yourself from start to finish. The whole course is over 5 hours long and you can follow along in all versions of FL Studio. It’s important to note that you’re not only going to learn how to use FL Studio and it’s instruments and plugins, you’re not only going to learn music production techniques, you’re also going to learn the complete start to finish song making process and how it all fits together. That’s really important, because it means when you start making your own music you’ll be able to apply the knowledge you have learned in a much more organised, constructive and usable way. Check out the course overview video by following this link https://www.borntoproduce.com/products/fl-studio-tutorial-for-beginners

It's a fantastic vocal effect that can be used in a subtle way to widen vocals and add more texture or in a dramatic way as a commanding artistic effect.

It can be used in any DAW if you have the vocodex plugin or any vocoder plugin. There are some great free vocoders out there including one from TAL.

You only need 3 things:
1) A vocal to be the Modulator
2) A synth or instrument to be the Carrier
3) The free vocoder plugin in FL Studio, Vocodex

It's also good to experiment with other modulators and carriers.
Maybe try a vocal and a piano?
Vocal and guitar? 
The possibilities are endless :)

It is used to simulate, with high precision, natural acoustic spaces and Hardware reverb units.

It does this using convolution mathematics and an impulse response of the room/hardware. Luckily for us, we don't need to know anything complicated to get fantastic results that are not possibly with an algorithmic reverb like Fruity Reverb 2.

Think of the FL Studio Mobile project as the core of the track. SHARE the .flm project between your desktop computer and your mobile device, adding and developing the project. When working inside the desktop version you can take advantage of the greater CPU to enhance it with the highest quality instrument and effect plugins in use by professionals. Alternatively you can make far more complex projects than your mobile device can handle. When transferring the project back, you can mute tracks to keep the CPU use under control.

JUMPSTYLE TUTORIAL | How to Make Jumpstyle in FL Studio (Like Jeckyll and Hyde)

In this video you'll learn how to make jumpstyle in FL Studio. Jumpstyle is very easy to make. With just a few elements, you're good to go...

For this project, I'm using a self-modified jump kick sample. I also made a basic saw lead with 3xOsc. Then I built a melody. A jumpstyle melody usually has short notes and typical ""jumpy"" rhythms.

I also made a simple saw bass with a filter for the break. Furthermore, I am using a snare sample and a ride sample. And lastly, a sweep effect made with 3xOsc.

When you play it all together, it sounds very Jeckyll & Hyde -ish.

These are really all the basics to make jumpstyle. It's very easy to make.

FL STUDIO ARP TUTORIAL | How to Make an Arpeggiator in FL Studio Arpeggio Trance Arp EDM Arps

Hey, here's Cep again. Do you want to find out how to make an arpeggio in FL Studio very quickly and easily? You do? Great! I'll show you how.

To make an arp (which stands for arpeggio or arpeggiator), you first need to have a sound. A lead type of sound would be good, like the 3x Osc sound in the video. With that sound, it's a good idea to draw long notes on the Piano Roll. These notes will be chopped up later by the arpeggiator. You can even make chords like I did.

To access the arpeggiator in FL Studio, click the ""Miscellaneous functions"" tab of your sound. In this tab you can find a section called ""Arpeggiator"". An arpeggiator can give fast (or slow) rhythms to your sound, using different patterns and notes.

In the video I will play with all of its settings, so you can take a listen to how it changes the sound.

For the full transcript and article visit:
https://screechhouse.com/fl-studio-arp-tutorial-how-to-make-an-arpeggiator-in-fl-studio-arpeggio-trance-arp-edm-arps

So, there it is: a quick and easy way to make arps. Make sure to visit the links in the description above to get access to extra resources that will help you make awesome music.

Do you want to find out how to make an arpeggio in FL Studio very quickly and easily? You do? Great! I\'ll show you how.\n\nTo make an arp (which stands for arpeggio or arpeggiator), you first need to have a sound. A lead type of sound would be good, like the 3x Osc sound in the video. With that sound, it\'s a good idea to draw long notes on the Piano Roll. These notes will be chopped up later by the arpeggiator. You can even make chords like I did.\n\nTo access the arpeggiator in FL Studio, click the ""Miscellaneous functions"" tab of your sound. In this tab you can find a section called ""Arpeggiator"". An arpeggiator can give fast (or slow) rhythms to your sound, using different patterns and notes.\n\nIn the video I will play with all of its settings, so you can take a listen to how it changes the sound.\n\nFor the full transcript and article visit:\nhttps://screechhouse.com/fl-studio-arp-tutorial-how-to-make-an-arpeggiator-in-fl-studio-arpeggio-trance-arp-edm-arps\n\nSo, there it is: a quick and easy way to make arps. Make sure to visit the links in the description above to get access to extra resources that will help you make awesome music.\n\nIf you found this video to be helpful, I\'d really appreciate it if you could hit that LIKE button.\n\nIf you have any questions you would like me to answer, just leave a COMMENT down below.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nWANT TO HELP THE CHANNEL GROW?\nTo reach more people, simply share a link or video with one of your friends to introduce them to my work.

EfAUj3lvW3A,2019-04-22T16:01:19Z,UCIcCXe3iWo6lq-iWKV40Oug,FL Studio Flex - First Look and Full Tutorial,"In this video I show you Flex - The brand new, free stock plugin synthesizer in FL Studio 20.2.
It is an incredible tool for music production and in this video I give you a complete beginner to advanced guide of the plugin and showcase a few of it's sounds.

It's designed to be a professional, preset based synth with the ability to control macros and parameters to fine tune each preset to your needs. They have focused on making the presets as usable as possible - they are not simply trying to fill up space. There are packs from some incredible sound designers and many more to come in the future. 

I like the user interface and I think the whole image line team should be very proud of this big step forward for FL Studio 20. It's one of the best stock plugins I've seen in a long time.
Many are calling this the FL Studio version of Nexus but I believe it will be so much more - and the GUI is far better than reFX Nexus.

To get the Beta version :
Log into your image line account and go to the forum.
https://forum.image-line.com/viewforum.php?f=1990﻿

From there you can access the beta download.
be aware that this will install a Beta version of FL Studio 20 alongside your current version. Read the terms and conditions and fully understand what it is before you commit to it.
Back up anything important when using Beta software! You've been warned! 

AHDSR -  Often called "" ADSR"" 
These envelopes determine how the filter or volume will behave over time.
You can shape the sound by making if fade in, hold at a lower value, release fast or slow etc. The best way to learn this is to get hands on and have fun with it!

Note - On the display modes I said "" Lows on the right, Highs on the left""
Obviously I meant the other way around but got my words twisted!

ROLLING BASSLINE TUTORIAL | How to Make Rolling Bass FL Studio (Rolling Bass Trance, Techno, EDM)


if you’re an EDM producer, sooner or later you need to know how to make a strong rolling bassline. A rolling bassline, commonly found in trance, house or techno music, is a bass that follows an upbeat rhythm, or a sequence if you will.


But the problem starts if you don’t know how to make one or how to do it correctly. Else, you will end up with a lame bass or a pathetic mix, which is very frustrating and a waste of time.


That’s why I will give you all the essential steps to make an energetic rolling bassline AND keep an impressive mix. 

There are many people who can benefit from this video. Please share it with anyone you know.

A rolling bassline, commonly found in trance, house or techno music, is a bass that follows an upbeat rhythm, or a sequence if you will.\n\n\nBut the problem starts if you don’t know how to make one or how to do it correctly. Else, you will end up with a lame bass or a pathetic mix, which is very frustrating and a waste of time.\n\n\nThat’s why I will give you all the essential steps to make an energetic rolling bassline AND keep an impressive mix. \n\nThere are many people who can benefit from this video. Please share it with anyone you know.\n\nIf you have any questions you would like to get answered, leave a comment down below.\n\n***********************************\n\n🔔 SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/c/ScreechHouse?sub_confirmation=1\n🌐 WEBSITE: https://screechhouse.com\n📱 FACEBOOK: https://fb.me/screechhouse\n💗 DONATE: https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=F8UXE99PWYERU\n\n🎵 HARDSTYLE SAMPLE PACK: https://eepurl.com/cYAah1\n🎚️ HARDSTYLE MIXING COURSE: https://screechhouse.com/hardstyle-mixing-mastering\n📚 BOOKS: https://amazon.com/author/screechhouse\n💬 CEP’S MENTORSHIP™: https://screechhouse.com/consulting \n\n***********************************\n\n🎧 MUSIC PRODUCTION SHORTCUTS:\nhttps://screechhouse.com\n\nHardstyle, Rawstyle, EDM, Trance, Big Room House, Hardcore, Jumpstyle, Old School & Early'}",en,

RAWSTYLE BASS | How to Make Hardstyle Bass FL Studio | Sylenth1 Bass Tutorial Raw Hardstyle Tutorial

Hey guys, it’s Cep. In this video I will show you how to make a rawstyle / hardstyle bass with Sylenth1. At the end of the video you can also listen to a cool euphoric rawstyle melody on top of this bass. So, stay tuned!

For now, let's see how to make a rawstyle bass like the one in the video.

I will play with many of these settings for you to hear how it affects the sound. Simply look at the settings my mouse is pointing at and listen to the tweaks.

P.S. to get you started, I did include bass sounds in my hardstyle sample pack. Free download via the link above!

B.t.w. I didn't use any mixer effects. This is 100% Sylenth1. No, I lied... I only used a limiter to limit the signal. But it doesn't change the sound.

All right. At the end I gave this bass some context. Melody time! The melody lead synth is also Sylenth1 b.t.w. Watch my HARDSTYLE CHORDS video and RAWSTYLE MELODY video to learn how to make it.

FL STUDIO COMPRESSION TUTORIAL | How to Use Compressor FL Studio Tutorial | How to Compress FL Studio

In this video you will learn how to use the Fruity Compressor in FL Studio very easily. When you understand how this compressor works, you can use the same principles and apply it with any other compressor plugins. We will be using the Fruity Compressor because it's very basic and easy to understand.

People often make a big deal out of compression, but it's actually really simple. Especially when you understand what it comes down to.

So, what does a compressor do?

The only thing you need to remember is: a compressor controls the volume dynamics of your sound or mix. 

But what does that mean?

You can set a compressor to tell it WHEN and HOW it should change the volume of a signal. That's basically all it does. So, you determine when the compressor should be active and how the compressor should deal with the volume of a sound.

To do that there are a few buttons we can use. The Fruity Compressors has 6 knobs that we can control and set how we want it to act. Let’s take a look at all the knobs and then go to FL Studio for some live action.

THRESHOLD: determines the volume at which the compressor kicks in. If a certain amount of volume (dB) is reached, the compressor will start.
RATIO: determines the amount of compression. A low ratio results in ""weak"" compression and a high ratio results in ""aggressive"" compression.
GAIN: determines the volume of the compressed output signal. You can normalize or limit the output sound by changing the Gain.
ATTACK: determines the time (in milliseconds) it takes to reach full compression. It basically sets the moment the compressor should start working.
RELEASE: determines the time (in milliseconds) it takes for the compressor to stop acting. It basically sets the moment the compressor should stop working.
TYPE: determines the ""type"" of compression. It controls the rate at which compression is applied. SOFT means gradual increase of compression. HARD means immediate increase of compression. VINTAGE and MEDIUM are in between those 2 extremes.

To simplify:

TRESHOLD: the volume at which the compressor starts.
RATIO: the amount of compression.
GAIN: the volume after the compression is applied.
ATTACK: How long it takes for the compressor to start.
RELEASE: How long it takes for the compressor to stop.
TYPE: the rate of compression.

Common practices for using compression is to create snappy attacks in certain sounds or to make a sound pump more. Let's explore both of these by compressing a snare sample. The sample is from my free sample pack. You can download it via the link above.

Think of the FL Studio Mobile project as the core of the track. SHARE the .flm project between your desktop computer and your mobile device, adding and developing the project. When working inside the desktop version you can take advantage of the greater CPU to enhance it with the highest quality instrument and effect plugins in use by professionals. Alternatively you can make far more complex projects than your mobile device can handle. When transferring the project back, you can mute tracks to keep the CPU use under control.

________________________________________________ 

New Generation

Sometimes inspiration comes at you thick and fast... but sometimes not. Instacomposer is your saviour when creativity runs dry, or when you just need your talent topped up. This MIDI generation plugin can conjure melody, rhythm, bass, pads and chords at the click of a button - all using artificial intelligence to create genuinely useful and musical riffs. This is the next step in automatic composition, using a complex algorithm to determine notes, harmonies and chords based on your personal preferences. With this much composing power at your fingertips, you’ll never be stuck in a musical rut again.

Artificial Intelligence

The backbone of Instacomposer is a behind-the-scenes decision making matrix that creates notes based on both mathematics and musical knowledge. Plus, the artificial intelligence factors in a whole host of parameters that you can set in the bottom panel, from repetition probability to the complexity of chord shapes. Harmonic variations, strumming techniques and note density are just some of the myriad of options that can be adjusted, feeding the algorithm your own personal set of preferences. 

Total Flexibility

Instacomposer is as unique as you are, taking into account your chosen scale, time signature and riff length. Choose to create new sequences for one, some or all of the 5 tracks, and in any combination of melody, rhythm, bass, pad and chord. 

MIDI Editor

The onboard MIDI editor can be used to tweak the output of Instacomposer within the interface itself. This means that you can manipulate the music before it leaves the plugin, adding your own creativity and personal style on top of what the plugin has offered you. Move, copy and delete notes within a familiar piano-roll interface, even changing the velocity. 

MIDI Export

Drag the MIDI tracks straight out of Instacomposer and into your DAW for ultimate ease of use. Alternatively, set up multi-channel instruments and route the MIDI from Instacomposer into your favourite VSTi’s. In this way you can preview all 5 tracks simultaneously, without ever leaving the Instacomposer environment. 

Presets

Instacomposer includes a huge number of factory presets; useful musical motifs to get you up and running quickly which can eventually become the basis for whole tracks. 

W. A. Production are real-life producers making creative plugins to help you achieve studio quality processing quickly and easily. Enjoy!

Think of the FL Studio Mobile project as the core of the track. SHARE the .flm project between your desktop computer and your mobile device, adding and developing the project. When working inside the desktop version you can take advantage of the greater CPU to enhance it with the highest quality instrument and effect plugins in use by professionals. Alternatively you can make far more complex projects than your mobile device can handle. When transferring the project back, you can mute tracks to keep the CPU use under control.

yi0J9JsRdI4,2019-10-19T17:30:19Z,UCIcCXe3iWo6lq-iWKV40Oug,How To Use Compression - Detailed Tutorial,"Hi I'm Michael Wynne. I'm a Scottish audio engineer and founder of In The Mix.

Understanding compression and how to hear it is an essential mixing skill.
In this video, I am going into a huge amount of detail to explain how to deeply hear and understand vocal compression so that you are no longer confused. I will show you all the important settings while compressing vocals and guitar.

Video Notes:
1) Listen to compression when all your tracks are playing, if you can't hear the other instruments and vocals it is usually a waste of time (unless you are highly experienced...in which case...why do you watch my videos!)

2) Often you need compression to make a vocal sound natural in a mix, surprisingly - This is due to how the microphone picks up some peoples voice

3) Have an Aim! If you don't know what you are aiming for, how will you be able to guarantee a good result? When you listen to the uncompressed audio, ask yourself:
""What do I want to change?"" 
""Do I need more sustain on this vocal?"" 
""Are my vocals too punchy or transient?"" 

4) Compression Settings

▶Threshold 
The point or level in dB where the compression will start being applied.

▶Ratio 
How much compression should be applied?
2:1 = Gentle Compression
10:1 = Aggressive Compression

A ratio of 4:1 means that the signal has to go 4dB above the threshold to get 1dB out (3db of compression)
8dB over = 2dB out etc ( 6db of compression!)
This 4:1 ratio means only 25% of the signal above the threshold will pass through, so this is very noticeable.

A ratio of 2:1 means that for every 2 dB the signal goes over the threshold, the compressor will only allow 1 dB through, so this only allows 50% of the signal above the threshold to pass through, this is considered gentle.

The higher the number, the more gain reduction will be experienced when the signal passes the threshold. 20:1 and higher is usually getting into the range of limiting, where you have a virtually infinite ratio to prevent any peaks.

▶Attack 
How fast should the compression start after the threshold is passed?
Fast attack time = Heavy, soft vocals
Slower attack = Punchy, transient vocals

▶Release 
How fast does the compressor recover after the signal falls below the threshold?
Slow release = Mushy vocals 
Fast release = Choppy vocals

▶Makeup Gain
Compression turns your audio signal down, so we apply a boost at the end to bring it back up to the original level. With this boost applied and the peaks brought down, the overall signal is louder and more full!

▶Knee 
The knee of a compressor makes the threshold act more smoothly, so that compression is triggered in a smoother or more gradual manner. Experiment to see if it gives you a more natural tone.

FL STUDIO CHOIR TUTORIAL | How to Make Choir in FL Studio | Choir Hardstyle Choir Effect Choir Sound

In this video you'll learn how to make a choir sound in FL Studio, with Sytrus. This basically works for any type of EDM genre. I will simply be showing you all the settings. I started with the Choir 2 preset in Sytrus and changed some parameters to get this sound.

Oscillator 1 actually isn't active. You can as well ignore these settings. In this moment of ""ignorance"", make sure you don't forget to grab my free sample pack. Download it via the link above.

Oscillator 2 is the only active oscillator. Just look at the settings, especially the type of waveform on the top left. 

Only filter 1 is enabled and it's set to a LP3 type of filter (Low Pass 3). The DRIVE knob works well to boost the signal, so I turned it open.

In the FX section, only the chorus is enabled. It's set to 4 voices with quite some depth and speed. This helps to add some fullness and movement to the sound.

The Sytrus is routed to a mixer track. Here we can give it some extra effects. The first effect in the chain is an EQ. With the EQ the sound is shaped to remove some mid frequencies and add some high frequencies. The waveshaper doesn't do much. It boosts the volume slightly. Of course, the choir synth needs some reverb. This gives it a sense of space. I used the Valhalla reverb here and shaped it with some effects.

This is all as far as the sound goes. Keep in mind that you can tweak it however you want. It's a matter of taste and what sounds good in your mix.

Now let's play some chords with it! If you don't know chords, please watch my ""How to Make Chords in FL Studio"" video. Drawing longer notes like I do, makes it sound more string-like or pad-like.

To put this choir sound into perspective, I used this hardstyle / rawstyle melody. Just try to pay attention to the choirs in this little snippet. Listen how it adds something to the melody and atmosphere. It fills up the sound and it plays well with the melody. Pretty string-like.

How do you get it to play well with the melody? That's actually really easy! The notes of the choir sound follow the exact same chords as the melody. You can clearly see this when I place the choir sound on top of the melody. The grey notes represent the melody. Again, please take a look at my how to chords video. There you'll learn more about this. Each first note of a chord change is always your starting point. Just draw longer notes from there and they automatically fit.

Before we go, let me quickly show you the Sytrus Choir presets. You can start there and tweak the sound to your liking. There are many plugins with great choir sounds, but I simply wanted to show you a good FL Studio ONLY option. There's really plenty to choose from.

Chuki is the 2nd channel of Chuki Beats. The Chuki Beats channel was started in 2014 and gained a lot of attention and succes because of the free hip hop instrumentals & free hip hop rap beats I provided! My Hip Hop instrumentals have been used by numerous big youtubers (Comedyshortsgamer, JOOGSQUAD PPJT, OpTic Pamaj, Ryan Williams, ... ) After a while we started to upload different content to the channel as well (Beat Breakdowns, Making A Beat series, Prod. By Chuki series, Featuring the best rappers, Vlogs, Live Beatmakings, etc...) Now that's in the past because Chuki Beats will contain all of my instrumentals and this 'Chuki' channel will contain all of the extra content I make. I wanted to be more free in terms of which content i'm making!

HARDSTYLE TOK TUTORIAL | How to Make Hardstyle Punch Kick | Hardstyle Kick FL Studio Kick Tutorial

Hey guys, it's Cep here. In this video I will show you how to build the TOK or PUNCH part of a hardstyle kick in FL Studio. 

First you need to have a hardstyle kick TAIL, like this one here. Watch my other hardstyle kick videos to learn how to make these. Now you can sample this tail part and cut out elements to use for your tok. I always cut out the tok part, the ""tick"" part and the clean 909 kick part (from the undistorted signal). Just like I show you here.

- The tok is about 100 ms long.
- The tick is about 10-20 ms long.
- The 909 kick is about 200 ms long.

So, everything is cut from the original kick tail. We're going to use this now to build a tok.

Everything I do is FL Studio ONLY. This way you can always use my video as a guide. It saves you a lot of money as well (for buying ""special"" plugins).

The samples we just cut are now added to the playlist in a new FL project. It's good to arrange them in the order I have here: tick, tok, 909. There is an automation clip underneath each sample. This controls the volume. It allows for full control over the ""length"" of each sample.

The TICK is there for the snappy attack. It's short, snappy and has extra high frequencies. The TOK is there for the body and mid frequencies. I found that separating the TOK from the TICK a bit, helps to get more punch. It sounds better. The 909 is there to give the punch more ""oompff"", more bass and more power. Again, separating it from the TOK a bit helps to make it sound right.

If you haven't yet, you can download a free hardstyle sample pack via the link above. It also contains all these hardstyle kick elements.

Hopefully this video helps your hardstyle kicks. Feel free to check out my EDM Mixing Guide in the description and don't forget to click SUBSCRIBE. :-)

2mqibVWgKsw,2015-10-12T03:46:43Z,UC313K63WEDXCZE3-9lzXosQ,FL Studio 12 Tutorial - 11 - Steps per beat in FL Studio,"Now let us take a look into this ‘Steps per beat’.

From the previous video, remember our settings. It is still in these. Beat per bar is 4 and Steps per beat is 1.

Now let me play the metronome and record a melody.

I know that each rhythm note is a beat and I have 4 beats per bar.

Let me record the melody. And paste it in the playlist. Then let me make a rhythm for it.

Here, I can play only one rhythm note in beat. This single note fills the entire gap between two beats.

What is I wanted to play more rhythm notes those gaps?

FL Studio allows us to do that by splitting the beat into two or more steps. If I split a beat into 4 steps, then the first step falls on the beat. The next three steps fills in the gap between that beat and the next beat. And it goes like that.

Why do we need that? To make the rhythm interesting. Otherwise the rhythm could get boring.

So, this option ‘Steps per beat’ specifies the number of steps in beat.

What is FL Studio?

FL Studio is a leading Music Production System which can be used to compose and create songs. 

If you are into song composition, FL Studio might help you.

Also, I hope this tutorial series is helpful.","{'default': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2mqibVWgKsw/default.jpg', 'width': 120, 'height': 90}, 'medium': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2mqibVWgKsw/mqdefault.jpg', 'width': 320, 'height': 180}, 'high': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2mqibVWgKsw/hqdefault.jpg', 'width': 480, 'height': 360}, 'standard': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2mqibVWgKsw/sddefault.jpg', 'width': 640, 'height': 480}, 'maxres': {'url': 'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2mqibVWgKsw/maxresdefault.jpg', 'width': 1280, 'height': 720}}",Sam D,"['FL Studio (Software)', 'FL Studio 12', 'FL Studio 12 Tutorial', 'FL Studio free', 'FL Studio Tutorial', 'ITShorts.com', 'Sampath.com', 'Sam Dhanasekaran', 'Dhanasekaran', 'Music Production', 'Songwriting', 'Songwriter', 'Music Theory', 'MIDI', 'Musical Instrument Digital Interface', 'FLStudio', 'FLStudio 12', 'bar', 'beats per minute', 'tempo', 'music meter', 'steps per beat']",27,none,"{'title': 'FL Studio 12 Tutorial - 11 - Steps per beat in FL Studio', 'description': 'Now let us take a look into this ‘Steps per beat’.\n\nFrom the previous video, remember our settings.

Think of the FL Studio Mobile project as the core of the track. SHARE the .flm project between your desktop computer and your mobile device, adding and developing the project. When working inside the desktop version you can take advantage of the greater CPU to enhance it with the highest quality instrument and effect plugins in use by professionals. Alternatively you can make far more complex projects than your mobile device can handle. When transferring the project back, you can mute tracks to keep the CPU use under control.

e0q7-7OlGp8,2008-12-26T23:46:09Z,UCsjiX7LJLsIWyrDNFtaObxQ,Hardstyle kick tutorial by Yhimself - on FL Studio using 3xOsc,"Go here for my newest kick tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROurusc3WCA



Link to the .flp file: http://www.speedyshare.com/files/19497402/kick_tut.zip
Its a FL zipped loop file so just drag&drop ;) in this file i also cloned the tok sampler and pitched it down a bit ;)

Here is a sample of another kick i created using this technique:
http://www.speedyshare.com/366568910.html

And here is the link to download this tutorial in higher quality:
http://rapidshare.com/files/183520294/kick_tutorial_compiled_-_02_.wmv

When i started making hardstyle i had most trouble creating good kicks, and i searched youtube for tutorials but couldnt find any good one(taking a fruity kick and adding fast dist isnt going to make you a hs kick:P)

The kick in HS is very important, and it is very hard to get it to sound right, with special characteristics. But it is so much better to be able to make your own ones instead of just taking a blutonium boy hardkick sample ;P its the way to go if you want to make your music original!

Now that im starting to get the hang of it i thought i could make a tutorial for all of you who are new to hardstyle producing ;)

This kick maby didnt get specially good, but thats not the point, i just make a quick kick here to show you my technique, so you have an idea on how it can be done. And remember that i just make and export one kick, normally i make up to 3-4 kick samples and layer toghether (but i didnt have time for that now) You can also layer in a equalized snare sample or clap sample or other instruments ;) Its just important to quicly chop off everything after the ""tok"" of the kick with a cutoff filter -a hs kick is supposed to have a short punch(but a long released bass)

I use a vst called ""CamelPhat"" it makes creating hs kicks easy, but its basically a filter with bandpass and a built in distortion\overdrive generator. Hs kicks normally have a resonance at about 500-800hz (the frequency where the kick is distorted or equalized prominently\eminent)

Camelchrusher is the distortion part of camelphat, and u can download it for free from their website: http://www.camelaudio.com/camelcrusher.php
But it soesnt have the ""fat bandpass filter"" so youll have to improvise here and add a fruity filter INFRONT of camelchrusher and set it to bandpass at about 700hz..

And i use KarmaFX`s reverb on the tok, you can download karmafx plugin pack for free on their website ;)

ok! :D

Think of the FL Studio Mobile project as the core of the track. SHARE the .flm project between your desktop computer and your mobile device, adding and developing the project. When working inside the desktop version you can take advantage of the greater CPU to enhance it with the highest quality instrument and effect plugins in use by professionals. Alternatively you can make far more complex projects than your mobile device can handle. When transferring the project back, you can mute tracks to keep the CPU use under control.

No se considera como un tutorial para masterizar profesionalmente. Aquí  muestro varias formas y procedimientos que se llevan acabo hoy en día, más no son los únicos ni más avanzados procedimientos ya que se pueden hacer de diferentes formas con diferentes herramientas. El tutorial es meramente informativo. 

Al terminar la masterización se recomienda exportar en wav 16 bits con la opción de dithering activada (ya sea de FL Studio o de Ozone 5) y 320 kbps en mp3 :) .
